	    Hello everyone. I am Gabriele Kukauskaite. The founder of this company. How did I get there?
		Well, working with webpage design has been my passion since high school. Having done a few small websites 
		in that time I was sure that one day I will have my own web design company. And this year, when I moved to 
		England from Lithuania to study Computer Science at Sheffield University, I saw a great opportunity to 
		accomplish my dream of creating my own web development and design company. In a few months time I managed 
		to gather a team of a few people and established my own company called 'Webmasters'.
